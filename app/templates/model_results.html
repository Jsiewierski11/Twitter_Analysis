    <p>
        For this application I tried several different models to see what performed best in sentiment classification.
        The first model I made for topic classification, Multinomial Naive Bayes, had an accuracy score of 96% so I decided 
        to stick with that model for this application. <br>
        Sentiment classification was a little tricker and I experimented with a couple different models. Below you can see the accuracy
        and the F1 scores of the different models that I trained for this project.
